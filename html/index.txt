<h3>Examples</h3>

<h4>Linear Solution</h4>

<p>For the moment there are two examples of the linear solution given in
the toolbox. They are <code>demBarenco1</code> and
<code>demBarenco2</code>. They fit a Gaussian process model to the
single input module associated with p53. <code>demBarenco1</code> used
the pre-processed data by PUMA package which shows the results
displayed in the ECCB submitted paper Figure 1. <code>demBarenco2</code> used
the pre-processed data by MAS5 method which is exactly same as the one
Barenco used in their paper. The original work is described in <a
href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/neill-bin/publications/bibpage.cgi?keyName=Barenco:ranked06&printAbstract=1">Barenco
<i>et al.</i></a>.

<p>To run the example write

<p><code>&gt;&gt; demBarenco1 </code>

<p>At the first time of running, it will take some time to load in the
data from the excel spreadsheet files. The excel spreadsheets contain
mmgMOS processed versions of the .cel files. This gives us a standard
deviation associated with the expression level as well as the
expression level itself.  The .cel files are available on <a
href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/">ArrayExpress</a>. Since they
are in log space, they must first be transfered to non-log space. Once
this process has been done, relevant profiles are extracted they are
saved in a file called
<code>./data/barencoPUMAdata.mat</code>. (Similarly, the associated
data file for MAS5 pre-processing are saved in a file called
<code>./data/barencoMASdata.mat</code>.) The variances and means
computed are therefore the variance and mean of a log normal
distribution. Obviously a Gaussian process can go negative but because
the expressions are not in log space they can't go negative. This is
clearly a weakness with this model.

<p>Once the data has been extracted, conjugate gradient optimisation of the
model commences. The first batch of numbers are a gradient check (the third
column should be zeros).

<p>The model that is being created is actually three models, one
Gaussian process for each repeat that is in the data. The covariance
parameters are shared though, this is a form of empirical hierarchical
Bayes. The implicit assumption is that each repeat is generated by an
independent sample of f(t) from a Gaussian process with the
<i>same</i> covariance parameters. This seems reasonable given the
biological experiments were from different .cel lines, <i>i.e.</i>
they were not technical replicates. However <a
href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/neill-bin/publications/bibpage.cgi?keyName=Barenco:ranked06&printAbstract=1">Barenco
<i>et al.</i></a> seem to treat the data as if there is one f(t) for
all replicates. We also tried this, and results (in terms of estimated
degradation, sensitivity and basal transcription) were not
significantly different.

<p>We follow <a
href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/neill-bin/publications/bibpage.cgi?keyName=Barenco:ranked06&printAbstract=1">Barenco
<i>et al.</i></a> in fixing the degradation rate of <i>p21</i> to 0.8
hr<sup>-1</sup> and the sensitivity to 1.0.

<i>et al.</i></a> for
the first replicate (scaled to match each profile).</center>

<h3>MAP Approximation for Non-Linear Response</h3>

<p>There are three examples of the use of the MAP approximation, the first is
<code>demBarencoMap1</code> which is the experiment shown in the
Figure 2 in the ECCB submitted paper. We implemented the Michaelis
Menten kinetics for the p53 data in this experiment.

<p>To run the example write

<p><code>&gt;&gt; demBarencoMap1 </code>

three replicates given in the experiments. Solid lines are mean
predictions, dashed lines are two standard deviations of

<p>The second is <code>demBarencoMap2</code> which is a simple
exponential response with an MLP style kernel as a prior over the
transcription factor concentration, and the third is
<code>demBarencoMap3</code> which is a recreation of the linear
experiment given above, made as a sanity check.

<h4>Repression Solution</h4>

<p>For the moment there is only one example of the repression case
given in the toolbox. It is <code>demEcoliMap1</code> which fits a
Gaussian process model to the single input module associated with
E. coli data set. <code>demEcoliMap1</code> used the same microarray
data as <a
href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/neill-bin/publications/bibpage.cgi?keyName=Khanin:repression06&printAbstract=1">Khanin <i>et al.</i>, 2006</a>. They identify 14 target genes which are
repressed by the TF LexA and the mRNA measurement for these genes are
collected over six time points.

<p>Predicted expression levels for all 14 target genes. Parameters
shown were obtained by maximum likelihood. Standard errors were not
available for this two-dye microarray data. There is no replica and
therefore a gene-specifec noise variance parameter was estimated for
each target gene. Data and reconstructed profiles are given in the
original scale. Times is measured in minutes.  </center>

<h4>Cascaded Differential Equations</h4>

<p>The last example shows a simple cascade of differential
equations. We applied the driven input model to a simple cascade in
Drosophila mesoderm development, focusing on the transcription factor
Mef2 (Myocyte enhancing factor 2).  We selected six targets of Mef2
identified by Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) assays [<a
href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/neill-bin/publications/bibpage.cgi?keyName=Sandmann:temporal06&printAbstract=1">Sandmann
<i>et al.</i>, 2006</a>] and which were observed to be up-regulated
after Mef2 is expressed. Affymetrix time course microarray data from
wild-type embryos [<a
href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/neill-bin/publications/bibpage.cgi?keyName=Tomancak:systematic02&printAbstract=1">Tomancak
<i>et al.</i>, 2002</a>] provides us with observations of Mef2
expression (y(t)) and the expression of the target genes xj (t) at
hourly intervals. The microarray time course was replicated three
times, and we used all three replicates to train the model
parameters. The raw data was downloaded from
<a href="ftp://ftp.fruitfly.org/pub/embryo_tc_array_data/">ftp://ftp.fruitfly.org/pub/embryo_tc_array_data/</a>. the relevant profile
(including selected target genes' names, expression levels and
standard errors) for generating the results shown in the submitted
paper are saved in a file called <code>./data/mef2Data.mat</code>.
