\abbreviations{TF transcription factor; ChIP Chromatin Immunoprecipitation;}

\dropcap{T}ranscription factors are key nodes in the gene regulatory
networks that determine the function and fate of
cells. An important first step in uncovering a gene regulatory network
is the identification of target genes regulated by a specific
transcription factor (TF). A
common approach to this problem is to experimentally locate physical binding
of TF proteins to DNA sequence {\em in vivo} using a genome-wide
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiment~\cite{Ren2000,Iyer2001}. However, recent studies have shown that many observed binding events are neutral and do not regulate transcription, while regulatory binding events often occur at enhancers that are not proximal to the target gene that they control~\cite{Li2008,MacArthur2009}. Therefore, the task of identifying transcriptional
targets requires the integration of ChIP binding predictions
with evidence from expression data to help associate binding events
with target gene regulation. If there is access to expression data from a mutant in which the TF has
been knocked out or over-expressed, then differential expression of genes between wild-type
and mutant is indicative of a potential regulatory
interaction~\cite{Furlong2001}. Available spatial expression data for the
TF and putative target can also provide support for a hypothesised
regulatory link. 

A problem with the above approach is that the creation of mutant
strains is challenging or impossible for many TFs of interest. Even
when viable mutants are available then they may provide very limited information because of redundancy or due to the
confounding of signal from indirect regulatory feedback. For these reasons it
is useful to seek other sources of evidence to complement ChIP binding
predictions. In this contribution we demonstrate how a dynamical model of wild-type transcriptional
regulation can be used for genome-wide scoring of putative target genes. All that is required to apply
our method is wild-type time series data collected over a period
where TF activity is changing. Our approach allows for complementary
evidence from expression data to be integrated with ChIP binding data
for a specific TF without carrying out TF perturbations. 

To score putative targets we use the data likelihood under a simple
cascaded differential equation model of transcriptional regulation. The regulation model
we apply is ``open'' in the sense that we do not explicitly model regulation of the TF
itself. To deal with this technical issue we use a recently developed
non-parametric probabilistic inference methodology to
effectively deal with open differential equation
systems~\cite{Gao2008}. We model the TF concentration as a function
drawn from a Gaussian process prior distribution~\cite{Rasmussen2006}. This functional prior can either be placed
on the TF mRNA, for TFs primarily under transcriptional regulation,
or the TF protein, for TFs activated post-translationally. In the
application considered here the TFs are transcriptionally regulated
and we take the former approach. We use Bayesian marginalisation (also
known as Bayesian model averaging) to
integrate out this functional degree of freedom. This greatly reduces the
number of parameters required to model the data, making a
likelihood-based approach feasible even for short time series
datasets. 

There are many existing approaches to inferring gene regulatory networks from
time-series expression data, including dynamic Bayesian networks,
information theoretic approaches and differential equation approaches
(reviewed in \cite{Bansal2007a}). These methods typically require many
more data from a greater diversity of experimental conditions than are
available from the short unperturbed wild-type time series that we
consider. Indeed, most real gene expression time course data are short relative to the simulated data used to assess computational methods for network inference~\cite{Ernst2005}. However, our goal is more limited in scope since
we are primarily interested in providing additional support for hypothesised
targets of a specific TF. Again, most approaches to this problem are
designed for data containing large numbers of diverse conditions, as
exemplified by the DREAM 2 target identification
challenge~\cite{Stolovitzky2007} (challenge 1). Others
have addressed this target identification problem using time-series
data with a regulation model~\cite{Barenco2006a,Gatta2008}. However,
these approaches either require a known target set for training~\cite{Barenco2006a} or
they require measured TF protein data~\cite{Gatta2008}. As well as
these differences in the assumed prior knowledge and data available,
it is also difficult to validate other approaches on the same data used in these
studies as they only carried out validation of positive targets
that they identified, rather than using unbiased genome-wide
experimental validation. 

We validate our proposed method by comparing the model-based target
ranking with published ChIP-chip data for two TFs controlling early
mesoderm development in Drosophila. Our method is shown to be comparable
to, or outperform, the use of knockout mutant data which are available
for these TFs. We demonstrate that a model-based approach is significantly
better than a simpler approach using correlation with TF
expression. We further show how integrating complementary wild-type spatial
{\em in situ} expression data can greatly improve target ranking accuracy.

\section{Gaussian process inference for a linear activation model}

A Gaussian process is a probability distribution over
functions $f$ which take the value $f(t)$ at time
$t$. Analogous to the Gaussian distribution, which is fully characterised by a mean and variance, the Gaussian process is
characterised by a mean function $\mathrm{E}[f(t)]$ and a covariance
function $k(t,t')=\mathrm{E}[f(t)f(t')]-\mathrm{E}[f(t)]\mathrm{E}[f(t')]$
where the expectation is over function evaluations at times $t$ and
$t'$. 

For the prior distribution of TF mRNA concentration profile $f$ we use a zero-mean squared exponential covariance
$k(t,t')=a\exp(-(t-t')^2/l)$. Samples from a Gaussian process with this choice
of covariance are smooth, infinitely differentiable, stationary functions. Although single-cell mRNA counts may be low
and vary in a highly stochastic manner, here we consider microarray data which
corresponds to a population average and is therefore more
appropriately modeled using a smooth process. The parameters $a$ and
$l$ describe the typical amplitude and time-scale of samples from
the prior. 

To simplify the inference we model translation and transcriptional
activation as simple linear processes using ordinary differential
equations,
\begin{align}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}p(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} & = f(t) - \delta
  p(t) \ , \label{eq:translation_ode} \\
  \frac{\mathrm{d}m_j(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} & = B_j+S_j p(t)-D_j m_j(t) \ , \label{eq:transcription_ode}
\end{align}
where $p(t)$ is the TF protein and $m_j(t)$ is the $j$th target mRNA
concentration at time $t$. The parameters $B_j$, $S_j$ and $D_j$ are the
baseline transcription rate, sensitivity and decay rate respectively
for the mRNA of $j$th target (as described in \cite{Barenco2006a}).
The parameter $\delta$ is the decay rate of the TF protein.
This linear system of differential equations can be
explicitly solved and we find that the functions $p$ and $m_j$ are
linear operators of $f$. Given $k$ target genes the functions $f$ and $\bm m\equiv[m_j]$ therefore
describe a $k$+1-dimensional Gaussian process prior $p(f,\bm m|\theta)$
for which the covariance function can be calculated explicitly in terms of the
$3$ global and $3k$ gene-dependent model parameters
$\theta=[\delta,a,l,\{B_j,S_j,D_j\}]$ (see Materials and Methods). 

A microarray time course experiment provides a data vector $\bm y$ containing the noise-corrupted TF and target mRNA
measurements at $n$ times,
$\bm y=[\hat{f}(t_1),\hat{f}(t_2),\ldots,\hat{f}(t_n),\{\hat{m}_j(t_1),\ldots,\hat{m}_j(t_n)\}]^\mathrm{T}$. This is a continuous-time modeling framework so there is no
requirement that times are equally spaced. We assume Gaussian noise:
$p(\bm y|f,\bm m)=\prod_i{\cal
  N}(\hat{f}(t_i)|f(t_i),\sigma_{if}^2)\prod_j{\cal
  N}(\hat{m_j}(t_i)|m_j(t_i),\sigma_{ijm}^2)$ where the gene and condition
specific measurement variance parameters $\sigma_{if}^2$ and $\sigma_{ijm}^2$ are obtained from a probe-level analysis of the microarray data~\cite{Liu2005,Pearson2009} (see
Materials and Methods). The log-likelihood for the model parameters
$\theta$ can then be calculated exactly using standard Gaussian process regression
techniques to integrate out the functions $m_j$ and $f$~\cite{Rasmussen2006}. For $R$ replicate datasets the log-likelihood is
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    L(\theta) & = \log p(\bm y_1,\bm y_2,\ldots,\bm y_{R}|\theta) \\
    & = \sum_{r=1}^{R} \log \!\int 
    \!\!p(\bm y_r|f,\bm m)p(f,\bm m|\theta) \, \mathrm{d}\!f\mathrm{d}\bm m\\
    & = \sum_{r=1}^{R} \left[-\frac{1}{2}\bm y_r^\mathrm{T} K_r^{-1} \bm y_r -
      \frac{1}{2}\log|K_r|\right] -nR\log 2\pi
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $K_r$ is the covariance matrix for the
noise-corrupted dataset $\bm y_r$ under the Gaussian process prior (see
Materials and Methods). This allows us to compute the set of model
parameters $\theta$ by maximum
likelihood using gradient-based optimisation. 

Rather than assuming that the TF protein is primarily under transcriptional control, as indicated by Eq.~(\ref{eq:translation_ode}), one can alternatively use the idea pioneered
in~\cite{Barenco2006a} and model the TF protein as an unobserved
latent variable. This approach can naturally be carried out using a
similar Gaussian process framework as shown in~\cite{Gao2008}. However, that procedure requires a set of known
targets for training the model whereas the approach described above
can be applied without any prior knowledge of targets. We therefore
prefer the above cascade model for cases where the level of active TF is under direct transcriptional control. 

\section{Results}

We applied our model-based approach to identify targets of the TFs Twist and Mef2 which regulate mesoderm and muscle development in Drosophila~\cite{Sandmann2007}. We used a microarray dataset containing three replicated time-series of 12 time points collected hourly throughout Drosophila embryogenesis using wild-type embryos~\cite{Tomancak2002}.  Quiet candidate targets were eliminated by
considering average z-scores of expression values as described in
Materials and Methods.

For each TF we fitted two sets of Gaussian process models. In one approach all other genes were considered as individual candidate targets one at a
time (``single-target models'').  The candidate targets were ranked according to their likelihood under the model.  It is worth noting that even the global
parameters can vary between models for different genes under this approach as the models
are fitted completely independently. In an alternative approach we fitted another set of models using the five
top-ranking genes in the single-target case as the training set (``multiple-target models''; see
Materials and Methods).  An illustration comparing these alternative
modeling approaches is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gpdisim_models}. The
single-target model is more flexible because each
potential target gene can be associated with a different inferred TF
protein profile. The multiple-target model is constrained to explain
all targets with the same TF protein profile and may therefore assign
a low score to targets that have a high score according to the
single-target model (this is the case for gene FBgn0003486 in
Fig.~\ref{fig:gpdisim_models}). Nevertheless, both models are
sufficiently flexible to fit target genes with significantly different
profiles (genes FBgn0033188 and FBgn0035257 in
Fig.~\ref{fig:gpdisim_models}).

For comparison, candidates were also ranked by correlation of the
expression profile with the TF expression profile (``correlation'')
and by $q$-value of differential expression in TF knock-out
experiments from~\cite{Sandmann2006a,Sandmann2007} (``knock-out'').

 % \label{fig:dros_global_evaluation}
\end{figure}

The accuracy of the ranking was evaluated by looking at the global
fraction of $N$ top-ranking targets that are significantly
differentially expressed in knock-outs of the TFs and the fraction
of targets with ChIP-chip binding within 5000 base
pairs of its beginning or end in the data
from~\cite{Sandmann2006a,Sandmann2007}.  For Mef2, this latter
frequency is only computed for genes in the part of the genome covered
by the ChIP-chip data. Both of our model-based approaches are found to be superior to the knock-out results in terms of ChIP binding enrichment and are mostly superior to the correlation results in terms of both ChIP binding enrichment and knock-out differential expression (see Fig.~\ref{fig:dros_global_evaluation}). The model-based ranking results also show a consistently high level of significance. The single-target models perform slightly better than the multiple-target models in most cases.

\end{figure}

Because Twist and Mef2 are known to be mainly active in mesoderm and
muscle development, we also looked at accuracy among genes
with annotated expression in these tissues according to the
\emph{in situ} data from~\cite{Tomancak2002}. These results are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:dros_focused_evaluation}. We observe a larger relative increase in enrichment for ChIP binding events in the top-20 target gene predictions for Twist and Mef2 for this filtered set of genes. Results for Twist also show consistently improved results lower down the ranking for both model-based approaches. For Mef2, results lower down the ranking are comparable to using the correlation approach.

% The results for $N=10$ are only significantly better than random for
% Twist ChIP-chip, while for $N=50$ and especially $N=250$ the
% improvement is highly significant.  Especially for Twist the results
% are even now clearly better than any of the tested alternatives.

To assess the significance of the observed differences between alternative ranking approaches, we performed bootstrap
resampling of the data set.  In 100,000-fold resampling where the
relative performances of different methods were recorded for each
fold, the Gaussian process methods were superior to the alternatives
in over 95\% of the repeats in most Twist validation settings.
For Mef2, the differences, especially to correlation, are less
significant in this comparison.  (Full results in 
Supplementary Material.)

We also repeated the experiment with the method of~\cite{Gatta2008}
but using the TF expression levels as a proxy for the measured protein
levels.  The results of this method are in general comparable to
ranking by correlation; there are no cases where it would be
significantly better than correlation according to the bootstrap.
Using measured protein levels as proposed in~\cite{Gatta2008} would
naturally help, but unfortunately such information is not available in
this case or in general.  It is worth noting that any measurements of
protein levels could very easily be incorporated in our models as well.

\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{dros_data_size_evaluation}
  \caption{Evaluation results similar to those in 
    Figs.~\ref{fig:dros_global_evaluation} and 
    \ref{fig:dros_focused_evaluation} for single-target models
    for full data (12 time points) and sub-sampled data (7 time points).
    \label{fig:dros_data_size_evaluation}
  }
\end{figure}

Finally, since most expression time series are short~\cite{Ernst2005}
we assessed whether similar results could be obtained with fewer time
points. We sub-sampled the data keeping only 7 time points most
relevant in defining the Twist expression profile
(2,3,4,5,6,8,10 hours). The results in this case, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:dros_data_size_evaluation}, are almost identical to 
those obtained using the complete data showing that the model-based
approach presented here can be applied to typical short wild-type time
series data.

\section{Discussion}

The linear differential equation model is a simplification, and in
many cases unrealistic. It is, however, necessary to keep the
computational load at a level that allows performing the ranking in a
workstation rather than a supercomputer.

\begin{materials}
  \section{Expression data preprocessing} Drosophila developmental
  microarray time series from~\cite{Tomancak2002} were reprocessed
  using mmgMOS from the puma package~\cite{Pearson2009}.  The means of
  the log-scale expression values were equalized across chips.  The
  distributions over log-expression were transformed to means
  $\left(\hat{m}_i(t_j), \hat{f}_i(t_j)\right)$ and variances $\left((\sigma_{ijm})^2,
  (\sigma_{if})^2 \right)$ of absolute expression by minimising the squared
  deviation of 5\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\% and 95\% quantiles of a Gaussian
  distribution to corresponding quantiles obtained from mmgMOS.

  \section{Filtering quiet genes}
  Quiet genes can affect the ranking because any model with low or zero sensitivity can fit them
  well. Genes $j$ with an average z-score 
  $$ \frac{1}{Rn} \sum_{r=1}^R \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\hat{m}_{jr}(t_i)}{\sigma_{ijr}} < 1.8 $$
  were considered quiet and removed from the data set.  The threshold
  was selected by visually inspecting models for candidate targets:
  practically all targets below the threshold elicited a
  non-informative constant response from the model.
  
  \section{Covariance of the Gaussian Process}
  Differential
  equations~[\ref{eq:translation_ode}--\ref{eq:transcription_ode}]
  can be solved to obtain
  \begin{align*}
    %\label{eq:gpsim_f_ode_sol}
    p(t) &= \exp(-\delta t) \int_0^t f(v) \exp(\delta v) dv\ , \\
    m_j(t) &= \frac{B_j}{D_j} + S_j \exp(-D_j t) \int_0^t p(u)
    \exp(D_j u) du\ .
    %\label{eq:gpsim_f_x_sol}
  \end{align*}
  Using these solutions and assuming a squared exponential covariance
  for $f(t)$, $k_{ff}(t, t') = a \exp( -(t-t')^2/l^2)$, the covariance of target mRNAs is
  \begin{multline*}
    k_{m_j m_k}(t, t')
    = \frac{\sqrt{\pi} l a^2 S_j S_k}{2} \bigg(
    h_{jk}(t, t', \delta) + h_{kj}(t', t, \delta) \\
    - h_{jk}(t, t', D_j) - h_{kj}(t', t, D_k)
    \bigg)\ ,
  \end{multline*}
  where
  \begin{multline*}
    h_{jk}(t, t', D_x) = 
    \exp\left(\gamma_x^2\right)
    \frac{\exp(-D_x t - D_k t')}{(D_x + \delta) (D_j - \delta)}
    \bigg\{ 
    \\
    % \frac{(D_k + \delta)\exp((D_k-\delta) t') - 2\delta}{(D_k^2-\delta^2)}
    \left(\frac{\exp((D_k-\delta) t') - 1}{D_k-\delta} +
      \frac{1}{D_k + D_x} \right)
    \left[\erf\left(\gamma_x - \frac{t}{l}\right) - \erf\left(\gamma_x\right)\right]
    \\
    + \frac{\exp((D_k+D_x)t')}{D_k+D_x}
    \left[\erf\left(\gamma_x + \frac{t'}{l}\right)
    - \erf\left(\gamma_x - \frac{\Delta t}{l}\right)\right]
    \bigg\}\ ,
  \end{multline*}
  where $\Delta t := t - t'$ and $\gamma_x = \frac{D_x l}{2}$.
  Similarly, 
  \begin{multline*}
    k_{f m_k}(t, t')
    = S_k a^2 \frac{\sqrt{\pi} l}{2(\delta - D_k)} \\
    \bigg\{
    \exp\left(\gamma_k^2 + D_k \Delta t \right)
    \left[\erf\left(\gamma_k + \frac{t}{l}\right) - \erf\left(\gamma_k + \frac{\Delta t}{l}\right)\right] \\
    -
    \exp\left(\gamma_\delta^2 + \delta \Delta t\right)
    \left[\erf\left(\gamma_\delta + \frac{t}{l}\right) - \erf\left(\gamma_\delta + \frac{\Delta t}{l}\right)\right]
    \bigg\}\ ,
  \end{multline*}
  where $\gamma_k = \frac{D_k l}{2}$ and $\gamma_\delta = \frac{\delta l}{2}$.

  \section{Training set ranking}
  The training set or multiple-target ranking was formed by fitting
  joint models to five assumed known targets together with each new
  candidate independently and ranking by model likelihood.  In our
  approach, the training set was formed by taking 5 highest-ranking
  targets from the basic method, but naturally any existing background
  knowledge of known targets should be utilised.  To speed up the
  computation, we first fitted a Gaussian process model to the
  training set genes alone.  All the parameters concerning these genes
  were then fixed when fitting the larger models to the training set
  plus each candidate.

  \section{Knock-out data processing}
  The knock-out data was processed as explained
  in~\cite{Sandmann2006a}.  $q$-values were computed at each time
  point using SAM~\cite{Saeed2003,Tusher2001}, the values at
  neighbouring time points were averaged and the minimum of these
  averages was used as the final value.  A cut-off value of 0.1 was
  used for detecting significant differential expression as
  in~\cite{Sandmann2006a}.
