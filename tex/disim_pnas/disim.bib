  abstract = {SUMMARY: Highly parallel genomic platforms like microarrays often
	present researchers with long lists of differentially expressed genes
	but contain little or no information on how these genes are regulated.
	rHVDM is a novel R package which uses gene expression time course
	data to predict the activity and targets of a transcription factor.
	In the first step, rHVDM uses a small number of known targets to
	derive the activity profile of a given transcription factor. Then,
	in a subsequent step, this activity profile is used to predict other
	putative targets of that transcription factor. A dynamic and mechanistic
	model of gene expression is at the heart of the technique. Measurement
	error is taken into account during the process, which allows an objective
	assessment of the robustness of fit and, therefore, the quality of
	the predictions. The package relies on efficient algorithms and vectorization
	to accomplish potentially time consuming tasks including optimization
	and differential equation integration. We demonstrate the efficiency
	and accuracy of rHVDM by examining the activity of the tumour-suppressing
	transcription factor, p53. AVAILABILITY: The version of the package
	presented here (1.8.1) is freely available from the Bioconductor

  abstract = {Genome-wide identification of bona-fide targets of transcription factors
	in mammalian cells is still a challenge. We present a novel integrated
	computational and experimental approach to identify direct targets
	of a transcription factor. This consists of measuring time-course
	(dynamic) gene expression profiles upon perturbation of the transcription
	factor under study, and in applying a novel "reverse-engineering"
	algorithm (TSNI) to rank genes according to their probability of
	being direct targets. Using primary keratinocytes as a model system,
	we identified novel transcriptional target genes of TRP63, a crucial
	regulator of skin development. TSNI-predicted TRP63 target genes
	were validated by Trp63 knockdown and by ChIP-chip to identify TRP63-bound
	regions in vivo. Our study revealed that short sampling times, in
	the order of minutes, are needed to capture the dynamics of gene
	expression in mammalian cells. We show that TRP63 transiently regulates
	a subset of its direct targets, thus highlighting the importance
	of considering temporal dynamics when identifying transcriptional
	targets. Using this approach, we uncovered a previously unsuspected
	transient regulation of the AP-1 complex by TRP63 through direct
	regulation of a subset of AP-1 components. The integrated experimental
	and computational approach described here is readily applicable to
	other transcription factors in mammalian systems and is complementary
	to genome-wide identification of transcription-factor binding sites.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Inference of latent chemical species in biochemical interaction
	networks is a key problem in estimation of the structure and parameters
	of the genetic, metabolic and protein interaction networks that underpin
	all biological processes. We present a framework for Bayesian marginalization
	of these latent chemical species through Gaussian process priors.
	RESULTS: We demonstrate our general approach on three different biological
	examples of single input motifs, including both activation and repression
	of transcription. We focus in particular on the problem of inferring
	transcription factor activity when the concentration of active protein
	cannot easily be measured. We show how the uncertainty in the inferred
	transcription factor activity can be integrated out in order to derive
	a likelihood function that can be used for the estimation of regulatory
	model parameters. An advantage of our approach is that we avoid the
	use of a coarsegrained discretization of continuous time functions,
	which would lead to a large number of additional parameters to be
	estimated. We develop exact (for linear regulation) and approximate
	(for non-linear regulation) inference schemes, which are much more
	efficient than competing sampling-based schemes and therefore provide
	us with a practical toolkit for model-based inference. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Affymetrix GeneChip arrays are currently the most widely
	used microarray technology. Many summarization methods have been
	developed to provide gene expression levels from Affymetrix probe-level
	data. Most of the currently popular methods do not provide a measure
	of uncertainty for the expression level of each gene. The use of
	probabilistic models can overcome this limitation. A full hierarchical
	Bayesian approach requires the use of computationally intensive MCMC
	methods that are impractical for large datasets. An alternative computationally
	efficient probabilistic model, mgMOS, uses Gamma distributions to
	model specific and non-specific binding with a latent variable to
	capture variations in probe affinity. Although promising, the main
	limitations of this model are that it does not use information from
	multiple chips and does not account for specific binding to the mismatch
	(MM) probes. RESULTS: We extend mgMOS to model the binding affinity
	of probe-pairs across multiple chips and to capture the effect of
	specific binding to MM probes. The new model, multi-mgMOS, provides
	improved accuracy, as demonstrated on some bench-mark datasets and
	a real time-course dataset, and is much more computationally efficient
	than a competing hierarchical Bayesian approach that requires MCMC
	sampling. We demonstrate how the probabilistic model can be used
	to estimate credibility intervals for expression levels and their
	log-ratios between conditions. AVAILABILITY: Both mgMOS and the new
	model multi-mgMOS have been implemented in an R package, which is
	available at http://www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/resources/puma.},

  __markedentry = {[magnus]},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most analyses of microarray data are based on point estimates
	of expression levels and ignore the uncertainty of such estimates.
	By determining uncertainties from Affymetrix GeneChip data and propagating
	these uncertainties to downstream analyses it has been shown that
	we can improve results of differential expression detection, principal
	component analysis and clustering. Previously, implementations of
	these uncertainty propagation methods have only been available as
	separate packages, written in different languages. Previous implementations
	have also suffered from being very costly to compute, and in the
	case of differential expression detection, have been limited in the
	experimental designs to which they can be applied. RESULTS: puma
	is a Bioconductor package incorporating a suite of analysis methods
	for use on Affymetrix GeneChip data. puma extends the differential
	expression detection methods of previous work from the 2-class case
	to the multi-factorial case. puma can be used to automatically create
	design and contrast matrices for typical experimental designs, which
	can be used both within the package itself but also in other Bioconductor
	packages. The implementation of differential expression detection
	methods has been parallelised leading to significant decreases in
	processing time on a range of computer architectures. puma incorporates
	the first R implementation of an uncertainty propagation version
	of principal component analysis, and an implementation of a clustering
	method based on uncertainty propagation. All of these techniques
	are brought together in a single, easy-to-use package with clear,
	task-based documentation. CONCLUSION: For the first time, the puma
	package makes a suite of uncertainty propagation methods available
	to a general audience. These methods can be used to improve results
	from more traditional analyses of microarray data. puma also offers
	improvements in terms of scope and speed of execution over previously
	available methods. puma is recommended for anyone working with the
	Affymetrix GeneChip platform for gene expression analysis and can
	also be applied more generally.},

	followed by microarray analysis (ChIP-on-chip) experiments during
	discrete time periods with computational approaches, we identified
	>2000 Twist-bound cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) and almost 500 direct
	target genes. Unexpectedly, Twist regulates an almost complete cassette
	of genes required for cell proliferation in addition to genes essential
	for morophogenesis and cell migration. Twist targets almost 25\%
	of all annotated Drosophila transcription factors, which may represent
	the entire set of regulators necessary for the early development
	of this system. By combining in vivo binding data from Twist, Mef2,
	Tinman, and Dorsal we have constructed an initial transcriptional
	network of early mesoderm development. The network topology reveals
	extensive combinatorial binding, feed-forward regulation, and complex

	RESULTS: As a first step to creating a comprehensive atlas of gene-expression

	by in situ hybridization to fixed Drosophila embryos. Of the genes
	assayed, 63.7\% displayed dynamic expression patterns that were documented

	were annotated using controlled vocabularies for anatomical structures
	that are organized into a developmental hierarchy. We also generated
	a detailed time course of gene expression during embryogenesis using
	microarrays to provide an independent corroboration of the in situ
	hybridization results. All image, annotation and microarray data
	are stored in publicly available database. We found that the RNA
	transcripts of about 1\% of genes show clear subcellular localization.
	Nearly all the annotated expression patterns are distinct. We present
	an approach for organizing the data by hierarchical clustering of
	annotation terms that allows us to group tissues that express similar
	sets of genes as well as genes displaying similar expression patterns.
	CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing gene-expression patterns by in situ hybridization
	to whole-mount embryos provides an extremely rich dataset that can
