Suggest change caption from Fig 1. from "It should be noted that the ..." to "Note that the ..."

I have trouble seeing the yellow line in Fig. 3 on the print out ... although I am slightly colour blind.

Odd that Figure 4 references ahead to Figure 5 in the caption.

Results section, another "It is worth noting" should be "Note"


"Are similar to the first two from the left" maybe "Are similar to the profiles in the first two columns of the figure" or similar
