  abstract =	 {{\bf Motivation:} Inference of 

                 \emph{latent chemical species} in biochemical
                 interaction networks is a key problem in estimation
                 of the structure and parameters of the genetic,
                 metabolic and protein interaction networks that
                 underpin all biological processes. We present a
                 framework for Bayesian marginalisation of these
                 latent chemical species through Gaussian process
                 priors.

                 {\bf Results:} We demonstrate our general
                 approach on three different biological examples of
                 single input motifs, including both activation and
                 repression of transcription.  We focus in particular
                 on the problem of inferring transcription factor
                 activity when the concentration of active protein
                 cannot easily be measured. We show how the
                 uncertainty in the inferred transcription factor
                 activity can be integrated out in order to derive a
                 likelihood function that can be used for the
                 estimation of regulatory model parameters.  An
                 advantage of our approach is that we avoid the use of
                 a coarse-grained discretization of continuous-time
                 functions, which would lead to a large number of
                 additional parameters to be estimated. We develop
                 efficient exact and approximate inference schemes,
                 which are much more efficient than competing
                 sampling-based schemes and therefore provide us with
                 a practical toolkit for model-based inference.

                 gene regulatory networks from gene expression data is
                 that the expression of a gene encoding the regulator
                 provides only limited information about its protein
                 activity. The proteins, which result from
                 translation, are subject to stringent
                 posttranscriptional control and modification. Often,
                 it is only the modified version of the protein that
                 is capable of activating or repressing its regulatory
                 targets. At present there exists no reliable
                 high-throughput technology to measure the protein
                 activity levels in real-time, and therefore they are,
                 so-to-say, lost in translation. However, these
                 activity levels can be recovered by studying the gene
                 expression of their targets. Here, we describe a
                 computational approach to predict temporal regulator
                 activity levels from the gene expression of its
                 transcriptional targets in a network motif with one
                 regulator and many targets. We consider an example of
                 an SOS repair system, and computationally infer the
                 regulator activity of its master repressor, LexA. The
                 reconstructed activity profile of LexA exhibits a
                 behavior that is similar to the experimentally
                 measured profile of this repressor: after UV
                 irradiation, the amount of LexA substantially
                 decreases within a few minutes, followed by a
                 recovery to its normal level. Our approach can easily
                 be applied to known single-input motifs in other
                 organisms.},
