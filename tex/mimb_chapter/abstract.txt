Mining regulatory network connections by ranking transcription factor
target genes using time series expression data


Reverse engineering the gene regulatory network is challenging because
the amount of available data is very limited compared to the
complexity of the underlying network.  We present a technique
addressing this problem through focussing on a more limited problem:
inferring direct targets of a transcription factor from short
expression time series.  The method is based on combining Gaussian
process priors and ordinary differential equation models allowing
inference on limited potentially unevenly sampled data.  The method is
implemented as an R/Bioconductor package and it is demonstrated by
ranking candidate targets of the p53 tumour suppressor.
