  abstract =	 {{\bf Motivation:} Quantitative estimation of the regulatory 
                 relationship between transcription factors and genes
                 is a fundamental stepping stone when trying to
                 develop models of cellular processes. This task,
                 however, is difficult for a number of reasons:
                 transcription factors' expression levels are often
                 low and noisy, and many transcription factors are
                 post-transcriptionally regulated. It is therefore
                 useful to infer the activity of the transcription
                 factors from the expression levels of their target
                 genes.\\\\

                 {\bf Results:} We introduce a novel probabilistic
                 model to infer transcription factor activities from
                 microarray data when the structure of the regulatory
                 network is known. The model is based on regression,
                 retaining the computational efficiency to allow
                 genome-wide investigation, but is rendered more
                 flexible by sampling regression coefficients
                 independently for each gene. This allows us to
                 determine the strength with which a transcription
                 factor regulates each of its target genes, therefore
                 providing a quantitative description of the
                 transcriptional regulatory network. The probabilistic
                 nature of the model also means that we can associate
                 credibility intervals to our estimates of the
                 activities. We demonstrate our model on two yeast
                 data sets. In both cases the network structure was
                 obtained using Chromatine Immunoprecipitation
                 data. We show how predictions from our model are
                 consistent with the underlying biology and offer
                 novel quantitative insights into the regulatory
                 structure of the yeast cell.\\\\

                 relationship between transcription factors and genes
                 is a fundamental stepping stone when trying to
                 develop models of cellular processes. Recent
                 experimental high-throughput techniques such as
                 Chromatine Immunoprecipitation provide important
                 information about the architecture of the regulatory
                 networks in the cell. However, it is very difficult
                 to measure the concentration levels of transcription
                 factor proteins and determine their regulatory effect
                 on gene transcription. It is therefore an important
                 computational challenge to infer these quantities
                 using gene expression data and network architecture
                 data.\\\\

                 {\bf Results}: We develop a probabilistic state space
                 model that allows genome-wide inference of both
                 transcription factor protein concentrations and their
                 effect on the transcription rates of each target gene
                 from microarray data. We use variational inference
                 techniques to learn the model parameters and perform
                 posterior inference of protein concentrations and
                 regulatory strengths. The probabilistic nature of the
                 model also means that we can associate credibility
                 intervals to our estimates, as well as providing a
                 tool to detect which binding events lead to
                 significant regulation. We demonstrate our model on
                 artificial data and on two yeast data sets in which
                 the network structure has previously been obtained
                 using Chromatine Immunoprecipitation
                 data. Predictions from our model are consistent with
                 the underlying biology and offer novel quantitative
                 insights into the regulatory structure of the yeast

                 relatively easy to measure, such as mRNA decay rates
                 and mRNA abundance levels, it is still very hard to
                 measure the active concentration levels of the

  abstract =	 {{\bf Motivation}: There often are many alternative 

                 models of a biochemical system. Distinguishing models
                 and finding the most suitable ones is an important
                 challenge in Systems Biology, as such model ranking,
                 by experimental evidence, will help to judge the
                 support of the working hypotheses forming each model.
                 Bayes factors are employed as a measure of evidential
                 preference for one model over another. Marginal
                 likelihood is a key component of Bayes factors,
                 however computing the marginal likelihood is a
                 difficult problem, as it involves integration of
                 nonlinear functions in multidimensional space. There
                 are a number of methods available to compute the
                 marginal likelihood approximately. A detailed
                 investigation of such methods is required to find
                 ones that perform appropriately for biochemical
                 modelling.\\\\

                 {\bf Results}: We assess four methods for estimation
                 of the marginal likelihoods required for computing
                 Bayes factors. The Prior Arithmetic Mean estimator,
                 the Posterior Harmonic Mean estimator, the Annealed
                 Importance Sampling and the Annealing-Melting
                 Integration methods are investigated and compared on
                 a typical case study in Systems Biology. This allows
                 us to understand the stability of the analysis
                 results and make reliable judgements in uncertain
                 context.  We investigate the variance of Bayes factor
                 estimates, and highlight the stability of the
                 Annealed Importance Sampling and the Annealing-
                 Melting Integration methods for the purposes of
                 comparing nonlinear models.\\\\

                 processes in living cells. Various methods have been
                 suggested to reconstruct network architecture from
                 gene expression data. However, most approaches are
                 based on qualitative models that provide only rough
                 approximations of the underlying events, and lack the
                 quantitative aspects that are critical for
                 understanding the proper function of biomolecular
                 systems.\\\\

                 {\bf Results:} We present fine-grained dynamical
                 models of gene transcription and develop methods for
                 reconstructing them from gene expression data within
                 the framework of a generative probabilistic
                 model. Unlike previous works, we employ quantitative
                 transcription rates, and simultaneously estimate both
                 the kinetic parameters that govern these rates, and
                 the activity levels of unobserved regulators that
                 control them. We apply our approach to expression
                 data sets from yeast and show that we can learn the
                 unknown regulator activity profiles, as well as the
                 binding affinity parameters.We also introduce a novel
                 structure learning algorithm, and demonstrate its
                 power to accurately reconstruct the regulatory
                 network from those data sets.\\\\

  abstract =	 {The basic underlying problem in reverse engineering of 
                 gene regulatory networks from gene expression data is
                 that the expression of a gene encoding the regulator
                 provides only limited information about its protein
                 activity. The proteins, which result from
                 translation, are subject to stringent
                 posttranscriptional control and modification. Often,
                 it is only the modified version of the protein that
                 is capable of activating or repressing its regulatory
                 targets. At present there exists no reliable
                 high-throughput technology to measure the protein
                 activity levels in real-time, and therefore they are,
                 so-to-say, lost in translation. However, these
                 activity levels can be recovered by studying the gene
                 expression of their targets. Here, we describe a
                 computational approach to predict temporal regulator
                 activity levels from the gene expression of its
                 transcriptional targets in a network motif with one
                 regulator and many targets. We consider an example of
                 an SOS repair system, and computationally infer the
                 regulator activity of its master repressor, LexA. The
                 reconstructed activity profile of LexA exhibits a
                 behavior that is similar to the experimentally
                 measured profile of this repressor: after UV
                 irradiation, the amount of LexA substantially
                 decreases within a few minutes, followed by a
                 recovery to its normal level. Our approach can easily
                 be applied to known single-input motifs in other
                 organisms.},

                 from time series microarray data, and generates a
                 ranked list of predicted targets. We applied HVDM to
                 the p53 network, validating predictions
                 experimentally using small interfering RNA. HVDM can
                 be applied in many systems biology contexts to
                 predict regulation of gene activity quantitatively.},

                 data that uses an undirected model with binary latent
                 variables and real-valued "visible" variables that
                 represent joint angles. The latent and visible
                 variables at each time step receive directed
                 connections from the visible variables at the last
                 few time-steps. Such an architecture makes on-line
                 inference efficient and allows us to use a simple
                 approximate learning procedure. After training, the
                 model finds a single set of parameters that
                 simultaneously capture several different kinds of
                 motion. We demonstrate the power of our approach by
                 synthesizing various motion sequences and by
                 performing on-line filling in of data lost during
                 motion capture.},

  abstract =	 {Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide a principled, practical, 
                 probabilistic approach to learning in kernel
                 machines. GPs have received increased attention in
                 the machine-learning community over the past decase,
                 and this book provides a long-needed systematic and
                 unified treatment of theoretical and practical
                 aspects of GPs in machine learning. The treatment is
                 comprehensive and self-contained, targetd at
                 researchers and students in machine learning and
                 applied statistics.\\\\

                 The book deals with the supervised-learning problem
                 for both regression and classification, and includes
                 detailed algorithms. A wide variety of covariance
                 (kernel) functions are presented and their properties
                 discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a
                 Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many
                 connections to other well known techniques from
                 machine learning and statistics are discussed,
                 including support-vector machines, neural networks,
                 splines, regularization networks, relevance vector
                 machines, and others. Theoretical issues including
                 learning curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are
                 treated, and several approximation methods for
                 learning with large datasets are discussed. The book
                 contains illustrative examples and exercises, and
                 code and datasets are available on the
                 Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background and
                 a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.},
