  abstract = {SUMMARY: Highly parallel genomic platforms like microarrays often
	present researchers with long lists of differentially expressed genes
	but contain little or no information on how these genes are regulated.
	rHVDM is a novel R package which uses gene expression time course
	data to predict the activity and targets of a transcription factor.
	In the first step, rHVDM uses a small number of known targets to
	derive the activity profile of a given transcription factor. Then,
	in a subsequent step, this activity profile is used to predict other
	putative targets of that transcription factor. A dynamic and mechanistic
	model of gene expression is at the heart of the technique. Measurement
	error is taken into account during the process, which allows an objective
	assessment of the robustness of fit and, therefore, the quality of
	the predictions. The package relies on efficient algorithms and vectorization
	to accomplish potentially time consuming tasks including optimization
	and differential equation integration. We demonstrate the efficiency
	and accuracy of rHVDM by examining the activity of the tumour-suppressing
	transcription factor, p53. AVAILABILITY: The version of the package
	presented here (1.8.1) is freely available from the Bioconductor

	(dynamic) gene expression profiles upon perturbation of the transcription
	factor under study, and in applying a novel "reverse-engineering"
	algorithm (TSNI) to rank genes according to their probability of
	being direct targets. Using primary keratinocytes as a model system,
	we identified novel transcriptional target genes of TRP63, a crucial

	were validated by Trp63 knockdown and by ChIP-chip to identify TRP63-bound
	regions in vivo. Our study revealed that short sampling times, in
	the order of minutes, are needed to capture the dynamics of gene
	expression in mammalian cells. We show that TRP63 transiently regulates
	a subset of its direct targets, thus highlighting the importance
	of considering temporal dynamics when identifying transcriptional
	targets. Using this approach, we uncovered a previously unsuspected
	transient regulation of the AP-1 complex by TRP63 through direct
	regulation of a subset of AP-1 components. The integrated experimental

	other transcription factors in mammalian systems and is complementary

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Time series expression experiments are used to study a
	wide range of biological systems. More than 80\% of all time series
	expression datasets are short (8 time points or fewer). These datasets
	present unique challenges. On account of the large number of genes
	profiled (often tens of thousands) and the small number of time points
	many patterns are expected to arise at random. Most clustering algorithms
	are unable to distinguish between real and random patterns. RESULTS:
	We present an algorithm specifically designed for clustering short
	time series expression data. Our algorithm works by assigning genes
	to a predefined set of model profiles that capture the potential
	distinct patterns that can be expected from the experiment. We discuss
	how to obtain such a set of profiles and how to determine the significance
	of each of these profiles. Significant profiles are retained for
	further analysis and can be combined to form clusters. We tested
	our method on both simulated and real biological data. Using immune
	response data we show that our algorithm can correctly detect the
	temporal profile of relevant functional categories. Using Gene Ontology
	analysis we show that our algorithm outperforms both general clustering
	algorithms and algorithms designed specifically for clustering time

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Inference of latent chemical species in biochemical interaction
	networks is a key problem in estimation of the structure and parameters
	of the genetic, metabolic and protein interaction networks that underpin
	all biological processes. We present a framework for Bayesian marginalization
	of these latent chemical species through Gaussian process priors.
	RESULTS: We demonstrate our general approach on three different biological
	examples of single input motifs, including both activation and repression
	of transcription. We focus in particular on the problem of inferring
	transcription factor activity when the concentration of active protein
	cannot easily be measured. We show how the uncertainty in the inferred
	transcription factor activity can be integrated out in order to derive
	a likelihood function that can be used for the estimation of regulatory
	model parameters. An advantage of our approach is that we avoid the
	use of a coarsegrained discretization of continuous time functions,
	which would lead to a large number of additional parameters to be
	estimated. We develop exact (for linear regulation) and approximate
	(for non-linear regulation) inference schemes, which are much more
	efficient than competing sampling-based schemes and therefore provide
	us with a practical toolkit for model-based inference. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {The basic underlying problem in reverse engineering of gene regulatory
	networks from gene expression data is that the expression of a gene
	encoding the regulator provides only limited information about its
	protein activity. The proteins, which result from translation, are
	subject to stringent posttranscriptional control and modification.
	Often, it is only the modified version of the protein that is capable
	of activating or repressing its regulatory targets. At present there
	exists no reliable high-throughput technology to measure the protein
	activity levels in real-time, and therefore they are, so-to-say,
	lost in translation. However, these activity levels can be recovered
	by studying the gene expression of their targets. Here, we describe
	a computational approach to predict temporal regulator activity levels
	from the gene expression of its transcriptional targets in a network
	motif with one regulator and many targets. We consider an example
	of an SOS repair system, and computationally infer the regulator
	activity of its master repressor, LexA. The reconstructed activity
	profile of LexA exhibits a behavior that is similar to the experimentally
	measured profile of this repressor: after UV irradiation, the amount
	of LexA substantially decreases within a few minutes, followed by
	a recovery to its normal level. Our approach can easily be applied
	to known single-input motifs in other organisms.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Affymetrix GeneChip arrays are currently the most widely
	used microarray technology. Many summarization methods have been
	developed to provide gene expression levels from Affymetrix probe-level
	data. Most of the currently popular methods do not provide a measure
	of uncertainty for the expression level of each gene. The use of
	probabilistic models can overcome this limitation. A full hierarchical
	Bayesian approach requires the use of computationally intensive MCMC
	methods that are impractical for large datasets. An alternative computationally
	efficient probabilistic model, mgMOS, uses Gamma distributions to
	model specific and non-specific binding with a latent variable to
	capture variations in probe affinity. Although promising, the main
	limitations of this model are that it does not use information from
	multiple chips and does not account for specific binding to the mismatch
	(MM) probes. RESULTS: We extend mgMOS to model the binding affinity
	of probe-pairs across multiple chips and to capture the effect of
	specific binding to MM probes. The new model, multi-mgMOS, provides
	improved accuracy, as demonstrated on some bench-mark datasets and
	a real time-course dataset, and is much more computationally efficient
	than a competing hierarchical Bayesian approach that requires MCMC
	sampling. We demonstrate how the probabilistic model can be used
	to estimate credibility intervals for expression levels and their
	log-ratios between conditions. AVAILABILITY: Both mgMOS and the new
	model multi-mgMOS have been implemented in an R package, which is
	available at http://www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/resources/puma.},

	factors that initiate anterior/posterior patterning in Drosophila
	bind to overlapping sets of thousands of genomic regions in blastoderm
	embryos. While regions bound at high levels include known and probable
	functional targets, more poorly bound regions are preferentially
	associated with housekeeping genes and/or genes not transcribed in
	the blastoderm, and are frequently found in protein coding sequences
	or in less conserved non-coding DNA, suggesting that many are likely
	non-functional. RESULTS: Here we show that an additional 15 transcription
	factors that regulate other aspects of embryo patterning show a similar
	quantitative continuum of function and binding to thousands of genomic
	regions in vivo. Collectively, the 21 regulators show a surprisingly
	high overlap in the regions they bind given that they belong to 11
	DNA binding domain families, specify distinct developmental fates,
	and can act via different cis-regulatory modules. We demonstrate,
	however, that quantitative differences in relative levels of binding
	to shared targets correlate with the known biological and transcriptional
	regulatory specificities of these factors. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely
	that the overlap in binding of biochemically and functionally unrelated
	transcription factors arises from the high concentrations of these
	proteins in nuclei, which, coupled with their broad DNA binding specificities,
	directs them to regions of open chromatin. We suggest that most animal
	transcription factors will be found to show a similar broad overlapping
	pattern of binding in vivo, with specificity achieved by modulating
	the amount, rather than the identity, of bound factor.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most analyses of microarray data are based on point estimates
	of expression levels and ignore the uncertainty of such estimates.
	By determining uncertainties from Affymetrix GeneChip data and propagating
	these uncertainties to downstream analyses it has been shown that
	we can improve results of differential expression detection, principal
	component analysis and clustering. Previously, implementations of
	these uncertainty propagation methods have only been available as
	separate packages, written in different languages. Previous implementations
	have also suffered from being very costly to compute, and in the
	case of differential expression detection, have been limited in the
	experimental designs to which they can be applied. RESULTS: puma
	is a Bioconductor package incorporating a suite of analysis methods
	for use on Affymetrix GeneChip data. puma extends the differential
	expression detection methods of previous work from the 2-class case
	to the multi-factorial case. puma can be used to automatically create
	design and contrast matrices for typical experimental designs, which
	can be used both within the package itself but also in other Bioconductor
	packages. The implementation of differential expression detection
	methods has been parallelised leading to significant decreases in
	processing time on a range of computer architectures. puma incorporates
	the first R implementation of an uncertainty propagation version
	of principal component analysis, and an implementation of a clustering
	method based on uncertainty propagation. All of these techniques
	are brought together in a single, easy-to-use package with clear,
	task-based documentation. CONCLUSION: For the first time, the puma
	package makes a suite of uncertainty propagation methods available
	to a general audience. These methods can be used to improve results
	from more traditional analyses of microarray data. puma also offers
	improvements in terms of scope and speed of execution over previously

  abstract = {We report the generation and analysis of functional data from multiple,
	diverse experiments performed on a targeted 1\% of the human genome
	as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE Project. These data have
	been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary
	and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective
	knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First,
	our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively
	transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in
	primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and
	those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination
	of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about
	transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific
	regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and
	histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin
	structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA
	replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration
	of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to
	mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons,
	has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning
	the functional landscape of the human genome. Together, these studies
	are defining a path for pursuit of a more comprehensive characterization
	of human genome function.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cell-fate specification and tissue differentiation during
	development are largely achieved by the regulation of gene transcription.
	RESULTS: As a first step to creating a comprehensive atlas of gene-expression
	patterns during Drosophila embryogenesis, we examined 2,179 genes
	by in situ hybridization to fixed Drosophila embryos. Of the genes
	assayed, 63.7\% displayed dynamic expression patterns that were documented
	with 25,690 digital photomicrographs of individual embryos. The photomicrographs
	were annotated using controlled vocabularies for anatomical structures
	that are organized into a developmental hierarchy. We also generated
	a detailed time course of gene expression during embryogenesis using
	microarrays to provide an independent corroboration of the in situ
	hybridization results. All image, annotation and microarray data
	are stored in publicly available database. We found that the RNA
	transcripts of about 1\% of genes show clear subcellular localization.
	Nearly all the annotated expression patterns are distinct. We present
	an approach for organizing the data by hierarchical clustering of
	annotation terms that allows us to group tissues that express similar
	sets of genes as well as genes displaying similar expression patterns.
	CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing gene-expression patterns by in situ hybridization
	to whole-mount embryos provides an extremely rich dataset that can
	be used to identify genes involved in developmental processes that
	have been missed by traditional genetic analysis. Systematic analysis
	of rigorously annotated patterns of gene expression will complement
	and extend the types of analyses carried out using expression microarrays.},

  abstract = {Microarrays can measure the expression of thousands of genes to identify
	changes in expression between different biological states. Methods
	are needed to determine the significance of these changes while accounting
	for the enormous number of genes. We describe a method, Significance
	Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), that assigns a score to each gene
	on the basis of change in gene expression relative to the standard
	deviation of repeated measurements. For genes with scores greater
	than an adjustable threshold, SAM uses permutations of the repeated
	measurements to estimate the percentage of genes identified by chance,
	the false discovery rate (FDR). When the transcriptional response
	of human cells to ionizing radiation was measured by microarrays,
	SAM identified 34 genes that changed at least 1.5-fold with an estimated
	FDR of 12\%, compared with FDRs of 60 and 84\% by using conventional
	methods of analysis. Of the 34 genes, 19 were involved in cell cycle
	regulation and 3 in apoptosis. Surprisingly, four nucleotide excision
	repair genes were induced, suggesting that this repair pathway for
	UV-damaged DNA might play a previously unrecognized role in repairing
	DNA damaged by ionizing radiation.},

  abstract = {The development of the Drosophila mesoderm is initiated by the basic
	helix-loop-helix transcription factor twist. We identified a gene
	encoding a putative transcription factor, mes2, in a screen for essential
	mesoderm-expressed genes that function downstream of twist. Mes2
	protein belongs to a family of 48 Drosophila proteins containing
	MADF domains. MADF domains exist in worms, flies, and fish. Mes2
	is a nuclear protein first produced in trunk and head mesoderm during
	late gastrulation. At later embryonic stages, mes2 is expressed in
	glia of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and in tissues
	derived from the head mesoderm. We have identified a null mutation
	of mes2 that leads to developmental arrest in first instar larvae.
	Increased production of Mes2 in multiple embryonic and larval tissues
	almost always causes lethality. The ubiquitous or epidermal misexpression
	of mes2 in the embryo causes a dramatic loss of epidermal integrity
	resulting in the failure of dorsal closure. Our data show that the
	precise regulation of mes2 expression is critical for normal development
	in Drosophila and implicate Mes2 in the regulation of essential target
	genes.},

	data. We generated a high-resolution atlas of cis-regulatory modules

	mesoderm development. The binding profiles of cis-regulatory modules
	with characterized expression were used to train support vector machines
	to predict five spatio-temporal expression patterns. In vivo transgenic
	reporter assays demonstrate the high accuracy of these predictions
	and reveal an unanticipated plasticity in transcription factor binding
	leading to similar expression. This data-driven approach does not
	require previous knowledge of transcription factor sequence affinity,
	function or expression, making it widely applicable.},
