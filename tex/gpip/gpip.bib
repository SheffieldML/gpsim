  abstract =	 {{\bf Motivation:} Quantitative estimation of the regulatory 
                 relationship between transcription factors and genes
                 is a fundamental stepping stone when trying to
                 develop models of cellular processes. This task,
                 however, is difficult for a number of reasons:
                 transcription factors' expression levels are often
                 low and noisy, and many transcription factors are
                 post-transcriptionally regulated. It is therefore
                 useful to infer the activity of the transcription
                 factors from the expression levels of their target
                 genes.\\\\

                 {\bf Results:} We introduce a novel probabilistic
                 model to infer transcription factor activities from
                 microarray data when the structure of the regulatory
                 network is known. The model is based on regression,
                 retaining the computational efficiency to allow
                 genome-wide investigation, but is rendered more
                 flexible by sampling regression coefficients
                 independently for each gene. This allows us to
                 determine the strength with which a transcription
                 factor regulates each of its target genes, therefore
                 providing a quantitative description of the
                 transcriptional regulatory network. The probabilistic
                 nature of the model also means that we can associate
                 credibility intervals to our estimates of the
                 activities. We demonstrate our model on two yeast
                 data sets. In both cases the network structure was
                 obtained using Chromatine Immunoprecipitation
                 data. We show how predictions from our model are
                 consistent with the underlying biology and offer
                 novel quantitative insights into the regulatory
                 structure of the yeast cell.\\\\

                 analysis methodologies. We present a new approach,
                 hidden variable dynamic modeling (HVDM), which
                 derives the hidden profile of a transcription factor
                 from time series microarray data, and generates a
                 ranked list of predicted targets. We applied HVDM to
                 the p53 network, validating predictions
                 experimentally using small interfering RNA. HVDM can
                 be applied in many systems biology contexts to
                 predict regulation of gene activity quantitatively.},
