  abstract =	 {The basic underlying problem in reverse engineering of 
                 gene regulatory networks from gene expression data is
                 that the expression of a gene encoding the regulator
                 provides only limited information about its protein
                 activity. The proteins, which result from
                 translation, are subject to stringent
                 posttranscriptional control and modification. Often,
                 it is only the modified version of the protein that
                 is capable of activating or repressing its regulatory
                 targets. At present there exists no reliable
                 high-throughput technology to measure the protein
                 activity levels in real-time, and therefore they are,
                 so-to-say, lost in translation. However, these
                 activity levels can be recovered by studying the gene
                 expression of their targets. Here, we describe a
                 computational approach to predict temporal regulator
                 activity levels from the gene expression of its
                 transcriptional targets in a network motif with one
                 regulator and many targets. We consider an example of
                 an SOS repair system, and computationally infer the
                 regulator activity of its master repressor, LexA. The
                 reconstructed activity profile of LexA exhibits a
                 behavior that is similar to the experimentally
                 measured profile of this repressor: after UV
                 irradiation, the amount of LexA substantially
                 decreases within a few minutes, followed by a
                 recovery to its normal level. Our approach can easily
                 be applied to known single-input motifs in other
                 organisms.},

                 relatively easy to measure, such as mRNA decay rates

                 suggested to reconstruct network architecture from
                 gene expression data. However, most approaches are
                 based on qualitative models that provide only rough

                 {\bf Results:} We present fine-grained dynamical

                 transcription rates, and simultaneously estimate both
                 the kinetic parameters that govern these rates, and
                 the activity levels of unobserved regulators that
                 control them. We apply our approach to expression

                 relationship between transcription factors and genes
                 is a fundamental stepping stone when trying to
                 develop models of cellular processes. This task,
                 however, is difficult for a number of reasons:
                 transcription factors' expression levels are often
                 low and noisy, and many transcription factors are
                 post-transcriptionally regulated. It is therefore
                 useful to infer the activity of the transcription
                 factors from the expression levels of their target
                 genes.\\\\

                 {\bf Results:} We introduce a novel probabilistic
                 model to infer transcription factor activities from
                 microarray data when the structure of the regulatory
                 network is known. The model is based on regression,
                 retaining the computational efficiency to allow
                 genome-wide investigation, but is rendered more
                 flexible by sampling regression coefficients
                 independently for each gene. This allows us to
                 determine the strength with which a transcription
                 factor regulates each of its target genes, therefore
                 providing a quantitative description of the
                 transcriptional regulatory network. The probabilistic
                 nature of the model also means that we can associate
                 credibility intervals to our estimates of the
                 activities. We demonstrate our model on two yeast
                 data sets. In both cases the network structure was
                 obtained using Chromatine Immunoprecipitation
                 data. We show how predictions from our model are
                 consistent with the underlying biology and offer
                 novel quantitative insights into the regulatory
                 structure of the yeast cell.\\\\

                 experimental high-throughput techniques such as

                 information about the architecture of the regulatory
                 networks in the cell. However, it is very difficult

                 factor proteins and determine their regulatory effect
                 on gene transcription. It is therefore an important
                 computational challenge to infer these quantities
                 using gene expression data and network architecture

                 {\bf Results}: We develop a probabilistic state space

                 techniques to learn the model parameters and perform
                 posterior inference of protein concentrations and
                 regulatory strengths. The probabilistic nature of the
                 model also means that we can associate credibility

                 difficult problem, as it involves integration of
                 nonlinear functions in multidimensional space. There
                 are a number of methods available to compute the
                 marginal likelihood approximately. A detailed
                 investigation of such methods is required to find
                 ones that perform appropriately for biochemical
                 modelling.\\\\

                 {\bf Results}: We assess four methods for estimation
                 of the marginal likelihoods required for computing
                 Bayes factors. The Prior Arithmetic Mean estimator,
                 the Posterior Harmonic Mean estimator, the Annealed
                 Importance Sampling and the Annealing-Melting
                 Integration methods are investigated and compared on
                 a typical case study in Systems Biology. This allows
                 us to understand the stability of the analysis
                 results and make reliable judgements in uncertain
                 context.  We investigate the variance of Bayes factor
                 estimates, and highlight the stability of the
                 Annealed Importance Sampling and the Annealing-
                 Melting Integration methods for the purposes of
                 comparing nonlinear models.\\\\

                 {\bf Availability}: Models used in this study are
                 available in SBML format as the supplementary
                 material to this paper.\\\\
