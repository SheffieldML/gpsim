Description: The tiger package implements our methodology of Gaussian
 process differential equation models for analysis of gene expression
 time series from single input motif networks. The package can be used
 for inferring unobserved transcription factor (TF) protein concentrations
 from expression measurements of known target genes, or for ranking
 candidate targets of a TF.
